      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Understanding Hell Biblically</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">When most people hear the word hell, they already have a picture in their minds.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">You die.<br />You stand before God.<br />You are either accepted or rejected.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">If you are accepted, you go to heaven.<br />If you are rejected, you go straight to a fiery place of torment forever.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">That is the common image.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🔥 Underground</li>
        <li>🔥 Fire</li>
        <li>🔥 Screaming</li>
        <li>🔥 Immediate punishment</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">But when we actually open the Bible, the picture is more layered than that.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Scripture does not present hell as one simple moment.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It unfolds in stages.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">And much of the confusion comes from the fact that one English word is used to translate several different biblical ideas.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">📖 The Bible Did Not Originally Use the Word Hell</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">The Old Testament was written in Hebrew.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The New Testament was written in Greek.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Neither language originally used the English word hell.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">In the Old Testament, the word most often used is:</p>
      <p className="mb-4">📜 Sheol</p>
      <p className="mb-4">In the New Testament, the primary word is:</p>
      <p className="mb-4">📜 Hades</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Jesus also uses another word:</p>
      <p className="mb-4">📜 Gehenna</p>
      <p className="mb-4">When the King James Bible was translated in the early 1600s, the translators frequently used the single English word hell to translate all three.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🔥 Sheol</li>
        <li>🔥 Hades</li>
        <li>🔥 Gehenna</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Three different concepts became one English word.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">That blending shaped how many people think about the afterlife today.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But the Bible itself distinguishes between them.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">🌑 Sheol in the Old Testament</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">The first clear reference appears in Genesis 37.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Jacob believes his son Joseph has died.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">He says:</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Genesis 37:35<br />“I shall go down to Sheol to my son, mourning.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Jacob is not describing a lake of fire.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">He is not describing final judgment.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">In the Old Testament, Sheol refers to the realm of the dead.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>⚰️ The grave</li>
        <li>☠️ Death</li>
        <li>🌑 The place where the dead go</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">It is not fully described.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It is not mapped out in detail.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But it is presented as the destination of both the righteous and the wicked after death.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">David speaks of Sheol.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Psalm 16:10<br />“For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Job speaks of Sheol.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Job 14:13<br />“Oh that you would hide me in Sheol.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The Old Testament establishes the foundation.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Death leads somewhere.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But the details are limited.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">🌍 Hades in the New Testament</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">When we move into the New Testament, the language shifts from Hebrew to Greek.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Sheol becomes Hades.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The idea remains similar.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But the New Testament provides more clarity.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The clearest teaching comes from Jesus Himself.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">👑 Jesus and the Rich Man and Lazarus</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">In Luke 16, Jesus tells the story of a rich man and a poor man named Lazarus.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Luke 16:22 to 23<br />“The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham’s bosom. The rich man also died and was buried, and in Hades, being in torment…”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Notice something important.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Both men die.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Both enter Hades.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But their experiences are different.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🔥 One is in torment</li>
        <li>🤍 One is comforted</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Jesus describes a great chasm between them.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Luke 16:26<br />“A great chasm has been fixed.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">This reveals something crucial.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Hades is not one single undivided experience.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It contains separation.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">One side is comfort.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">One side is anguish.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The realm is shared.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The experience is not.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">🤍 What Is Abraham’s Bosom</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Jesus calls the place of comfort Abraham’s bosom.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">In the ancient world, people reclined at meals.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">To rest against someone’s chest represented closeness and acceptance.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🛡️ Safety</li>
        <li>🕊️ Peace</li>
        <li>🤍 Covenant belonging</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Abraham is used because he represents the covenant promise.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The righteous are pictured as resting in comfort within that promise.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">This is not yet heaven as later described.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It is still within Hades.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But it is a place of peace.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">✝️ What Changed After Jesus</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">After Jesus was crucified and buried, Scripture indicates that He descended to proclaim victory.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">1 Peter 3:18 to 19<br />“He went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Ephesians 4:9<br />“He descended into the lower regions.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">After the resurrection, believers are described differently.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">2 Corinthians 5:8<br />“To be away from the body is to be at home with the Lord.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">This suggests a shift.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Now, when believers die:</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🕊️ They go to be with the Lord</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Hades remains.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But it functions as a temporary holding place for the wicked awaiting judgment.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">🔥 Gehenna and Final Judgment</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">When Jesus warns about final punishment, He often uses the word Gehenna.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Gehenna was a real valley outside Jerusalem.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">In the Old Testament, it was associated with child sacrifice and idolatry.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Later, it became a burning dump.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🗑️ Waste</li>
        <li>🔥 Continuous fire</li>
        <li>⚠️ A place associated with judgment</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Jeremiah 7:31 condemns what happened there.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">When Jesus uses Gehenna, He is drawing on a vivid image His listeners understood.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Matthew 10:28<br />“Fear him who can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Gehenna represents final destruction and judgment.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It is not the temporary realm of Hades.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It points forward to something ultimate.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">🔚 The Lake of Fire</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Revelation clarifies what happens at the final judgment.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Revelation 20:13<br />“Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Revelation 20:14<br />“Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Revelation 20:15<br />“If anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">This reveals a sequence.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>☠️ Death</li>
        <li>🌑 Hades</li>
        <li>⚖️ Judgment</li>
        <li>🔥 The lake of fire</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Hades is temporary.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The lake of fire is final.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Even Death itself is destroyed.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">No more graves.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">No more waiting.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Only final judgment.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">📌 So What Is Hell</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Biblically, hell is not one single idea.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It is a process.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>☠️ Physical death</li>
        <li>🌑 Sheol or Hades</li>
        <li>⏳ Waiting</li>
        <li>⚖️ Judgment</li>
        <li>🔥 The lake of fire</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">The confusion comes from using one English word to describe multiple biblical concepts.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Scripture is more detailed than our modern assumptions.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Understanding these distinctions does not remove the seriousness of judgment.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It clarifies it.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The Bible presents a structured unfolding of events.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Not a simplistic picture.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">And clarity matters.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Because when we understand what Scripture actually says, we are better equipped to respond to it with seriousness, humility, and truth.</p>
