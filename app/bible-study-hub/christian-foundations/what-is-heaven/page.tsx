      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Understanding Heaven Biblically</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">When most people think about heaven, they picture clouds.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">White robes.<br />Golden streets.<br />Wings.<br />Floating.<br />Endless singing.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Or they imagine something vague.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">A bright place.<br />Peaceful.<br />Better than here.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But the Bible does not describe heaven as a cartoon in the sky.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It describes something far more layered.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Heaven in Scripture is not just one location.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It is presented in stages.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">And just like with hell, confusion often comes from flattening everything into one simple idea.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">So what is heaven, biblically?</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">☁️ The Bible Uses “Heaven” in More Than One Way</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">The word heaven does not always mean the same thing in Scripture.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">In Hebrew, the word is shamayim.<br />In Greek, it is ouranos.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Both words can refer to different realities.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The Bible uses heaven in at least three ways.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🌤️ The sky above us</li>
        <li>🌌 Outer space</li>
        <li>👑 The dwelling place of God</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Genesis 1:1 says:</p>
      <p className="mb-4">“In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">That includes everything above and beyond the earth.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But when most people ask about heaven, they are asking about the third meaning.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The dwelling place of God.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The place of eternal life.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">👑 Heaven as God’s Dwelling Place</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Throughout Scripture, heaven is described as the place where God reigns.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Psalm 11:4<br />“The Lord is in his holy temple; the Lord’s throne is in heaven.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Heaven is portrayed as:</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>👑 A throne room</li>
        <li>⚖️ A place of authority</li>
        <li>✨ A realm of holiness</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Isaiah gives us a powerful vision.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Isaiah 6:1<br />“I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Seraphim surround Him.<br />The temple shakes.<br />The glory fills the space.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">This is not clouds and harps.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">This is majesty.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Power.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Holiness beyond human categories.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Heaven is first and foremost where God’s presence is fully manifest.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">🌍 What Happens When a Believer Dies</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">After the resurrection of Jesus, the New Testament speaks clearly about what happens to believers.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">2 Corinthians 5:8<br />“To be away from the body is to be at home with the Lord.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Philippians 1:23<br />“To depart and be with Christ, for that is far better.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">When a believer dies, they go to be with Christ.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">That is heaven in its present form.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🕊️ Conscious</li>
        <li>🕊️ With the Lord</li>
        <li>🕊️ In peace</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">But this is not yet the final picture.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Scripture makes clear that this current heaven is not the end of the story.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">🔄 Heaven Is Not the Final Destination</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Many assume that heaven is where believers will remain forever.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But Revelation reveals something surprising.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Revelation 21:1<br />“Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The story does not end with humans going up.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It ends with heaven coming down.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Revelation 21:2<br />“I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The final picture is not disembodied souls floating in the sky.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It is resurrection.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It is restoration.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It is God dwelling with humanity on a renewed earth.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">🌳 The New Heaven and New Earth</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Revelation 21 and 22 give the clearest description.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">There is:</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>✨ No more death</li>
        <li>😢 No more mourning</li>
        <li>😭 No more crying</li>
        <li>💔 No more pain</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Revelation 21:3<br />“Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">This is Eden restored.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">In Genesis, God walked with humanity in the garden.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">In Revelation, God dwells with humanity again.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">There is a river of life.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">There is the tree of life.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">There is no curse.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The Bible does not end with escape from earth.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It ends with renewal of creation.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">🧍 Resurrection Matters</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Heaven is not just spiritual existence.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The Bible teaches bodily resurrection.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">1 Corinthians 15:52<br />“The dead will be raised imperishable.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Jesus Himself was resurrected bodily.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">He ate.<br />He walked.<br />He spoke.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The resurrection body is transformed.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Imperishable.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Glorified.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But still embodied.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Heaven is not eternal floating.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It is restored embodied life in a renewed creation.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">🏙️ The New Jerusalem</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Revelation describes a city.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Not clouds.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">A city.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">With foundations.<br />With gates.<br />With structure.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Revelation 21:21 describes streets of gold.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But this is not meant to satisfy greed.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It symbolizes purity and glory.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Gold so refined it is transparent.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The point is not luxury.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The point is perfection.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The city needs no sun.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Revelation 21:23<br />“The glory of God gives it light.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">God Himself is the light.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Heaven is defined by presence, not architecture.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">🤝 What We Will Experience</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Scripture does not answer every curiosity.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But it tells us what matters.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🕊️ We will see God</li>
        <li>👑 We will reign with Christ</li>
        <li>🎶 We will worship</li>
        <li>🤝 We will know and be known</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Revelation 22:4<br />“They will see his face.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">In Exodus, Moses could not see God’s face and live.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">In the final heaven, believers will see Him fully.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">No separation.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">No barrier.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">No sin.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">⚖️ Who Enters Heaven</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Heaven is not entered by effort.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It is entered through Christ.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">John 14:6<br />“I am the way, and the truth, and the life.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Revelation 21:27<br />“Nothing unclean will ever enter it.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Entry is not based on perfection.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It is based on redemption.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The book of life belongs to the Lamb.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Heaven is not earned.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It is granted through Christ’s finished work.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">📌 So What Is Heaven</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Biblically, heaven is:</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>👑 The present dwelling place of God</li>
        <li>🕊️ The place believers go after death</li>
        <li>🌍 The future renewed creation</li>
        <li>✨ The final restoration of all things</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">It is not merely escape.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It is fulfillment.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It is not clouds.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It is closeness.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It is not abstraction.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It is embodied resurrection in a restored world where God dwells with His people.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">From Genesis to Revelation, the story moves toward this.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Creation.<br />Fall.<br />Redemption.<br />Restoration.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Heaven is not the end of the story.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It is the completion of it.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">And in that completion, death is defeated.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Sin is removed.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">God is fully present.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">That is heaven.</p>
