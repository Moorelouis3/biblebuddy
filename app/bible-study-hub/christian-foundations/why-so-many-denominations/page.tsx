      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Why So Many Denominations</h1>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Understanding Christian Divisions</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">When people begin taking their faith seriously, they often run into something confusing.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Church labels.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Baptist.<br />Catholic.<br />Orthodox.<br />Pentecostal.<br />Methodist.<br />Non denominational.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">And the question naturally comes up:</p>
      <p className="mb-4">If we all follow Jesus, why are there so many different Christian groups?</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Did Jesus intend this?</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Did the apostles create this?</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Or did something happen along the way?</p>
      <p className="mb-4">To understand why denominations exist today, we have to start at the beginning.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">✝️ It Started With Jesus, Not Religion</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">When Jesus gave the Great Commission in Matthew 28:19, He did not say:</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Go and create separate religious systems.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">He said:</p>
      <p className="mb-4">“Go and make disciples of all nations.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The earliest believers were not called Christians at first.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">They were known as followers of The Way.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Acts 9:2 describes this movement.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It was not institutional.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It was not political.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It was a community built around:</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🕊️ The resurrection of Jesus</li>
        <li>📖 The apostles’ teaching</li>
        <li>🤝 Shared life and prayer</li>
        <li>🔥 Bold witness</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">The early Church met in homes.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">They broke bread together.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">They endured persecution.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">They were unified around Christ.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But history did not stop there.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">🏛️ The Early Church After Jesus</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">After Jesus ascended, leadership rested with the apostles.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Peter, James, John, Paul and others planted churches across the Roman Empire.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">These churches were united by doctrine but spread across different cultures.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Greek speaking believers.<br />Latin speaking believers.<br />Jewish believers.<br />Gentile believers.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">By the second and third centuries, regional bishops began overseeing churches in major cities.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Five major centers of Christianity emerged:</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>📍 Rome</li>
        <li>📍 Constantinople</li>
        <li>📍 Alexandria</li>
        <li>📍 Antioch</li>
        <li>📍 Jerusalem</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">This was still one Church.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But language, culture, and political tension slowly created distance.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The western Church spoke Latin.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The eastern Church spoke Greek.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Theology remained largely shared.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Culture did not.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">👑 Constantine and Institutional Christianity</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">In 313 AD, Emperor Constantine legalized Christianity through the Edict of Milan.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Persecution ended.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Christianity moved from underground to imperial favor.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Church leaders gained political influence.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Buildings were constructed.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Structure became formalized.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">By the late fourth century, Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The bishop of Rome gained increasing authority in the West.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">This development would shape what became Roman Catholicism.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Meanwhile, the eastern churches maintained a council based leadership model.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Tension slowly grew.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">⚔️ The Great Schism of 1054</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Over centuries, disagreements intensified between East and West.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Issues included:</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🗣️ Language and cultural differences</li>
        <li>👑 The authority of the Pope</li>
        <li>📖 Theological wording about the Trinity</li>
        <li>🏛️ Political rivalry between Rome and Constantinople</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">In 1054, the Church formally split.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">This event is known as the Great Schism.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Christianity divided into:</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>➡️ The Roman Catholic Church in the West</li>
        <li>➡️ The Eastern Orthodox Church in the East</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Roman Catholicism centralized authority in the Pope.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Eastern Orthodoxy rejected papal supremacy and maintained shared episcopal leadership.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Both claimed apostolic roots.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But they were now separate communions.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">This was the first major fracture.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">📜 The Reformation</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">By the 1500s, concerns about corruption and doctrinal drift within the Roman Catholic Church grew.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Issues included:</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>💰 The selling of indulgences</li>
        <li>📖 Limited access to Scripture in local languages</li>
        <li>⚖️ Authority of church tradition over biblical authority</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">In 1517, Martin Luther published the Ninety Five Theses.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">He called for reform based on Scripture.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The Protestant Reformation began.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Its central affirmations were:</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>📖 Scripture alone as final authority</li>
        <li>🙏 Salvation by grace through faith</li>
        <li>✝️ Christ alone as mediator</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">This created the second major division:</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>➡️ Roman Catholicism</li>
        <li>➡️ Protestant Christianity</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">From there, Protestant branches formed.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">🌳 The Growth of Protestant Denominations</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Lutherans formed around Luther’s theology.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Reformed and Presbyterians emphasized covenant theology and God’s sovereignty.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Anglicans developed in England.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Baptists emphasized believer’s baptism and local church autonomy.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Methodists emphasized disciplined spiritual growth.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Later movements included:</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🔥 Pentecostals emphasizing the gifts of the Spirit</li>
        <li>📖 Evangelicals emphasizing biblical authority and conversion</li>
        <li>🤝 Non denominational churches seeking independence from formal labels</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Some divisions were theological.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Some were cultural.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Some were reactions to imbalance.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Some were unnecessary.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Human weakness always plays a role.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">🧩 Why So Many Today</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Denominations exist because of:</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🧠 Differences in interpreting secondary doctrines</li>
        <li>🌍 Cultural and language diversity</li>
        <li>⚖️ Disagreements over authority</li>
        <li>🏛️ Historical political influence</li>
        <li>👥 Human pride and division</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Despite visible separation, many denominations still affirm historic Christian essentials:</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>✔️ Jesus is Lord</li>
        <li>✔️ He died and rose again</li>
        <li>✔️ Salvation is by grace through faith</li>
        <li>✔️ Scripture is authoritative</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">The visible Church is divided organizationally.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But unity in Christ still exists among those who hold to essential truth.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">📖 What Jesus Desired</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">In John 17:21, Jesus prayed:</p>
      <p className="mb-4">“That they may all be one.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Unity was always the desire.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Not forced uniformity.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Not political control.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Unity rooted in truth and faith in Him.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Denominations reflect history.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">They reflect theological development.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">They reflect the global expansion of Christianity.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">They also reflect human imperfection.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">📌 Final Perspective</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Jesus did not establish denominations.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">History did.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Culture did.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Disagreement did.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Sometimes reform did.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The Church has experienced:</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>📜 Apostolic unity</li>
        <li>🏛️ Institutional development</li>
        <li>⚔️ East West division</li>
        <li>📖 Reformation fracture</li>
        <li>🔥 Modern expansion</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Denominations can provide structure and community.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But they are not the foundation.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Christ is.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Labels explain history.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">They do not define salvation.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Christianity is built on the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Understanding the history removes confusion.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">And it refocuses attention where it belongs.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">On Christ Himself.</p>
