        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Your Body Is a Temple</h1>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">1 Corinthians 6:19-20 Explained</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">“Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.”<br />1 Corinthians 6:19-20</p>
        <p className="mb-4">This verse is often quoted in discussions about health, fitness, and self-care.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">But its meaning goes much deeper.</p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">🏛️ What Does It Mean?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Paul is not just talking about physical health.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">He is talking about spiritual reality.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Your body is a place where God’s Spirit lives.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">That makes your body sacred.</p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">💪 Why It Matters</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">If your body is a temple, it deserves respect.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Not because of pride or vanity, but because of God’s presence.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Taking care of your body is a way to honor God.</p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">📌 Why This Still Matters</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">This teaching is not just about rules.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">It is about relationship.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">God values you so much that He lives within you.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">When you understand this, you can live with purpose and dignity.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">And you can glorify God in everything you do.</p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Corinth Was Rebuilt and It Came Back Worse</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Corinth was once a powerful Greek city.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">But Rome destroyed it in 146 B C.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">For about a hundred years, Corinth was mostly ruins.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Then Julius Caesar rebuilt Corinth in 44 B C as a Roman colony.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">And the city came back with speed.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Corinth sat between two major harbors.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">One side connected toward Rome and Italy.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">The other side connected toward Asia and the Aegean Sea.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">So what poured into Corinth?</p>
        <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
          <li>🚢 Ships</li>
          <li>💰 Money</li>
          <li>🌍 Cultures</li>
          <li>🍷 Pleasure</li>
          <li>🔥 Sin</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">Corinth became wealthy fast.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">And Corinth became immoral fast.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">So much so that people used the phrase Corinthianize to describe reckless living.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">This was the environment surrounding the church Paul planted.</p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Worship in Corinth Was Not Private</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Corinth was filled with temples.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">But one of the most famous was the Temple of Aphrodite.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Aphrodite was the goddess of sex, love, fertility, and beauty.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">And worship there was not singing.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">It was sex.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Corinth had a culture where temple prostitution was normalized.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">People paid money and slept with temple prostitutes as part of worship.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">In that world, the body was a tool for spiritual expression.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Pleasure was treated like holiness.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Sex was not just entertainment.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">It was religious.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">That matters because Paul is talking to people who came out of that world.</p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">How the Church in Corinth Started</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Paul came to Corinth around A D 50 during his second missionary journey.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Acts 18 records this.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">He stayed about eighteen months.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">He preached Christ.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">He built the first church there.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">At first, he preached to the Jews.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Many rejected the message.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Then Paul turned toward the Gentiles.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Many of those Gentiles were raised in the exact culture Corinth was known for.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">They did not grow up with God’s law.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">They did not grow up with purity teaching.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">They grew up with idols, indulgence, and sexual freedom.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">They believed in Jesus.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">But they still carried Corinth inside of them.</p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Why Paul Had to Write This Letter</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Around A D 55 to 56, Paul was in Ephesus and received reports that the Corinthian church was in chaos.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">The letter of 1 Corinthians is not random.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">It is a response to real problems.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">The church was dealing with:</p>
        <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
          <li>😵 division over leaders</li>
          <li>🧠 confusion about Christian freedom</li>
          <li>🔥 sexual sin being tolerated</li>
          <li>🧍 a man sleeping with his stepmother<br />1 Corinthians 5:1</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">Some believers were basically saying:</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Jesus forgave us, so we can do whatever we want.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Paul shuts that down.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Because Christian freedom is not permission to return to slavery.</p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Your Body Is a Temple Now</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">This is the moment where the verse becomes personal.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">In Corinth, a temple meant something specific.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">A temple was where you offered your body to the gods.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Now Paul says something that would have sounded shocking:</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Your body is the temple.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Not a building.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Not a hilltop shrine.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Not a place where you go.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">A place where God lives.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">That is why Paul says:</p>
        <p className="mb-4">“Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God?”<br />1 Corinthians 6:19</p>
        <p className="mb-4">This is not just a rule.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">This is a new identity.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">God is not asking for your body as an offering.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">God is saying He has moved in.</p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">You Were Bought With a Price</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Paul continues:</p>
        <p className="mb-4">“You are not your own, for you were bought with a price.”<br />1 Corinthians 6:19 to 20</p>
        <p className="mb-4">In the ancient world, that language was not metaphor only.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">People understood purchase.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">They understood ownership.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">They understood slavery.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Paul is saying:</p>
        <p className="mb-4">You do not belong to sin anymore.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">You belong to God.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">And the price was not money.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Not gold.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Not silver.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Not good behavior.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">The price was the blood of Jesus.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">That changes the conversation completely.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Because if Jesus paid for you, you are not free to waste what He purchased.</p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Glorify God in Your Body</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Paul ends it with a command:</p>
        <p className="mb-4">“So glorify God in your body.”<br />1 Corinthians 6:20</p>
        <p className="mb-4">In Corinth, people used their bodies for false worship.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Paul is saying:</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Your body is sacred now.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Not because of what you have done.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">But because of who lives in you.</p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">What This Means Today</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Most people today do not live under a Temple of Aphrodite.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">But the same message is still everywhere.</p>
        <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
          <li>📱 Soft porn is normal</li>
          <li>🧲 Temptation is constant</li>
          <li>💸 People sell their bodies for attention</li>
          <li>🔥 Hookup culture is celebrated</li>
          <li>🧠 Lust is treated like a right</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">And the modern message is:</p>
        <p className="mb-4">It is your body. Do what feels good. No shame.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Paul gives a different message:</p>
        <p className="mb-4">You are not your own.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">You were bought with a price.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">That means the body is not meaningless.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">The body matters.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Because the Spirit lives there.</p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Final Reflection</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">This verse is not about shame.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">It is about value.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Your body is holy ground because God moved in.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">And when temptation shows up, this verse becomes a reminder:</p>
        <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
          <li>🕊️ You are God’s temple</li>
          <li>✝️ You were bought with a price</li>
          <li>🔥 Your body is not for sin</li>
          <li>👑 Your body is for God’s glory</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">So glorify God in your body.</p>
