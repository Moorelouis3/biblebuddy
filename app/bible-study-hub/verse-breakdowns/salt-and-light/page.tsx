      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Salt and Light</h1>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Matthew 5:13 to 16 Explained</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Matthew 5:13 to 16 takes place during what we call the Sermon on the Mount.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Jesus goes up on a mountain, sits down, and begins to teach.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">That detail matters.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">In Jewish culture, sitting was the posture of authority. Rabbis sat when delivering formal instruction. This was not casual conversation. It was intentional teaching.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>👥 Jesus is speaking directly to His disciples.</li>
        <li>🌍 Large crowds are also listening.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">That means this teaching is meant to shape the disciples while showing the watching world what life in the kingdom of God looks like.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">What Just Happened Before This</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Right before this passage, Jesus delivers the Beatitudes.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">He completely redefines what it means to be blessed.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>⚠️ Not power. The kingdom belongs to the poor in spirit.</li>
        <li>⚠️ Not status. The meek and merciful are called blessed.</li>
        <li>⚠️ Not wealth. Those who hunger for righteousness are satisfied.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Everything the culture associated with favor and success is turned upside down.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">And then Jesus moves from blessing to identity.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">From Blessing to Identity</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Jesus does not say, try to be salt.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">He does not say, attempt to shine.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🧂 “You are the salt of the earth.”</li>
        <li>💡 “You are the light of the world.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">This is not command first.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It is declaration.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">He is telling His followers who they are because they belong to Him.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Real discipleship cannot stay private.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">What you are will eventually be visible.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🧂 You Are the Salt of the Earth</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Salt in the modern world feels ordinary.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🛒 It is cheap and easy to buy.</li>
        <li>🧊 It melts ice on roads.</li>
        <li>👣 It gets stepped on without thought.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">That was not true in the first century.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Salt was valuable and essential.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🧊 Salt Preserved</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">There were no refrigerators.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Meat spoiled quickly.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Salt slowed decay.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It drew out moisture and prevented corruption.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Salt preserved by being different.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">If it became like the meat, it would fail.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">When Jesus says you are salt, He is saying:</p>
      <p className="mb-4">You are meant to slow spiritual and moral decay.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Not by blending in.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But by remaining distinct.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🍽 Salt Gave Flavor</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Without salt, food was bland.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Salt enhanced and revealed what was already there.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">In the same way, faithful believers bring clarity and meaning to the world.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Their presence should not make life dull.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It should make truth noticeable.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🕊 Salt Represented Covenant Faithfulness</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">In the Old Testament, salt was included in sacrifices.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It symbolized purity and enduring covenant.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Salt pointed to devotion that did not decay.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">This imagery would not have been lost on Jewish listeners.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Jesus is not calling His disciples insignificant.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">He is calling them essential.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">When Salt Loses Its Saltiness</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Ancient salt was often mixed with other minerals.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Over time, the true salty element could dissolve, leaving behind something that looked like salt but had no effect.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It could not preserve.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It could not flavor.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It was thrown onto roads.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>👣 Trampled underfoot.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Jesus is not describing loss of salvation.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">He is describing loss of effectiveness.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">When believers allow the surrounding culture to dilute their identity, they lose their impact.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Salt that does not function has no purpose.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">💡 You Are the Light of the World</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Again, identity.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Light in Scripture always contrasts darkness.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Darkness represents confusion and separation from God.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Light represents truth and life.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Believers do not generate their own light.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">They reflect Christ.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🌍 A City Set on a Hill</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Ancient cities were often built on hills for defense.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">At night, lamps inside the city made it visible from miles away.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">🌍 A city on a hill could not hide even if it tried.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Jesus is saying that genuine faith will be seen.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Not because it seeks attention.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But because transformation cannot remain invisible.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🪔 A Lamp Under a Basket</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Homes in the first century were dark.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">One small oil lamp could illuminate an entire room.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Covering it defeated its purpose.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Fear.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Desire for approval.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Comfort.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">These become the modern basket.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Jesus is not encouraging arrogance.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">He is confronting concealment.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Let Your Light Shine</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Matthew 5:16 brings it together.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">“Let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The goal is not attention.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The goal is direction.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>When someone sees humility.</li>
        <li>Integrity.</li>
        <li>Faithfulness.</li>
        <li>Love.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">The attention should not settle on the person.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It should point to God.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🙏 Visible faith directs glory upward.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Final Reflection</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Salt must remain distinct.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Light must remain uncovered.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Identity is not something you strive to manufacture.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It is something you live out.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">If you belong to Christ, you are salt.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">If you belong to Christ, you are light.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But salt that blends in loses effect.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Light that hides loses purpose.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">And when identity is lived faithfully, the world around it changes.</p>
