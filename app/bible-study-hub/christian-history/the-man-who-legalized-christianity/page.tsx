      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">The Man Who Legalized Christianity</h1>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Constantine and the Turning Point of the Church</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">After the resurrection, Jesus gathered His disciples and gave them a command.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">“Go therefore and make disciples of all nations… teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.”<br />Matthew 28:19 to 20</p>
      <p className="mb-4">No army.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">No political power.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">No royal backing.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Just obedience.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">For nearly three hundred years, that obedience often came with persecution.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">🔥 Christianity for the First Three Hundred Years</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">From 33 AD to 313 AD, Christianity was not safe.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Christians were not building cathedrals.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">They were gathering quietly in homes.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🔥 Blamed for disasters</li>
        <li>🦠 Used as scapegoats during plagues</li>
        <li>🏛️ Accused of threatening Roman unity</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Rome did not care what gods people worshipped.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Rome only required one thing.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>👑 Acknowledgment that Caesar was divine.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Christians refused.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">They would not worship the emperor.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">So they were:</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>⛓️ Arrested</li>
        <li>🧊 Executed</li>
        <li>🐅 Fed to animals in arenas</li>
        <li>🕯️ Forced into secrecy</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Yet Christianity continued to spread.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Not because it had power.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Because it had conviction.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">📄 The Major Waves of Persecution</h2>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🔥 64 AD<br />Under Emperor Nero, Christians were blamed for the Great Fire of Rome. Many were publicly tortured and killed.</li>
        <li>👑 81 to 96 AD<br />Domitian demanded to be called Lord and God. Christians refused and suffered.</li>
        <li>📄 98 to 117 AD<br />Under Trajan, Christianity was officially illegal. Accused believers who refused to recant were punished.</li>
        <li>🔥 161 to 180 AD<br />During the reign of Marcus Aurelius, plagues devastated Rome. Christians were blamed for angering the gods.</li>
        <li>⚔️ 303 AD<br />The Great Persecution under Diocletian and Galerius. Churches destroyed. Scriptures burned. Leaders imprisoned. Thousands executed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">This was the harshest persecution yet.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">And then everything changed.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">🏛️ Rome Was Fracturing</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">By the early fourth century, the Roman Empire was unstable.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🌍 Too large to manage</li>
        <li>⚔️ Too many external threats</li>
        <li>👑 Too many competing rulers</li>
        <li>💥 Constant civil conflict</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Power struggles erupted.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Multiple generals claimed the throne.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Armies marched against one another.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The empire was exhausted.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">⚔️ Enter Constantine</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Constantine was a Roman general.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Raised in military culture.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Formed in pagan religion.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Christianity was not his background.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">In 312 AD, Constantine marched toward Rome to fight for control of the empire.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">His army was outnumbered.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Then he claimed something extraordinary happened.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">🌤️ The Vision Before Battle</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Constantine later reported that he saw a sign in the sky.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>✝️ A cross<br />With the words<br />“In this sign, you will conquer”</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">That night, he claimed Christ appeared to him in a dream and confirmed the message.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Constantine ordered the symbol of Christ placed on his soldiers’ shields.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Against expectations, he won the Battle of the Milvian Bridge.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">From his perspective, Christ had granted victory.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">🛡️ 313 AD The Edict of Milan</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">In 313 AD, Constantine and Licinius issued the Edict of Milan.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Its effects were dramatic.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🕊️ Christianity was legalized</li>
        <li>🏛️ Churches could gather publicly</li>
        <li>📜 Confiscated property was returned</li>
        <li>⛓️ Persecution officially ended</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">For the first time in history, Christians could worship openly without fear of state execution.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">This marked a turning point.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">🏛️ What Happened After Legalization</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Legalization did not simply mean freedom.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It reshaped the church.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🏠 House gatherings became basilicas</li>
        <li>👑 Bishops gained influence</li>
        <li>📜 Church leaders advised emperors</li>
        <li>🌍 Christianity moved from margin to mainstream</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">In 325 AD, Constantine called the Council of Nicaea to resolve theological disputes, particularly regarding the nature of Christ.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">This council produced the Nicene Creed, affirming that Jesus is fully divine.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">For the first time, imperial authority and church doctrine intersected on a massive scale.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Christianity was no longer persecuted.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It was politically protected.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">⚖️ Was Constantine Truly Converted</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">History does not give a simple answer.</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>👀 Some point to his support of church reform and doctrinal clarity.</li>
        <li>🌞 Others note he continued using certain pagan imagery.</li>
        <li>⏳ He delayed baptism until shortly before death.</li>
        <li>⚔️ He remained a powerful and sometimes ruthless ruler.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Some historians see sincere faith.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Others see political strategy.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It may have been both.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">🔄 The Long Term Impact</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Constantine did not create Christianity.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It was already growing.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But he changed its trajectory.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Persecution stopped.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Public influence increased.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Imperial support strengthened church structure.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">And over time, Christianity became the dominant religion of the Roman Empire.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Power, however, always reshapes movements.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Sometimes for protection.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Sometimes with unintended consequences.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">📌 Why This Moment Matters</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">For three centuries, the church survived without power.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">After Constantine, the church had influence.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">That shift would eventually lead to:</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 ml-6 list-none">
        <li>🏛️ The formation of a unified imperial church</li>
        <li>⚖️ The later division between East and West</li>
        <li>📜 The shaping of what would become Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">But that is another chapter in history.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The legalization of Christianity marks one of the most significant turning points in church history.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">A persecuted movement became a protected institution.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">And the world would never be the same.</p>
