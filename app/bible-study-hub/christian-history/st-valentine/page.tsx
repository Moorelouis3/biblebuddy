      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-2">St. Valentine</h1>
      <h2 className="text-lg text-orange-900 font-semibold mb-6">The Martyr Behind the Modern Holiday</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Most people think Valentine’s Day is about romance.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">❤️ Flowers<br/>🍫 Chocolate<br/>💌 Cards</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But the holiday traces back to a Christian martyr.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">And the original story was not soft.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It was costly.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">🏛️ The Roman World in the Third Century</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">To understand Valentine, you have to understand Rome in the 200s AD.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">This was not a peaceful era.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The Roman Empire was unstable.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">👑 Emperors rose and fell quickly<br/>⚔️ Civil wars erupted frequently<br/>🛡️ Borders were constantly threatened</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It was a time historians call the Crisis of the Third Century.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Political chaos.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Military pressure.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Internal division.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">In the middle of that instability ruled Emperor Claudius II.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">👑 Claudius II and Military Strength</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Claudius II was a soldier emperor.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">He believed Rome needed strong, disciplined fighters.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">According to later Christian tradition, he came to believe something specific.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">That unmarried men made better soldiers.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The reasoning was simple.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">🛡️ Single men had fewer emotional ties<br/>🏠 They were less concerned about family<br/>⚔️ They were more willing to risk death</p>
      <p className="mb-4">So he outlawed marriage for young men.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Whether this was empire wide policy or more localized is debated by historians, but the tradition has remained strong in church history.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">For Christians, this was not just a civic issue.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It was spiritual.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">💍 Marriage in Early Christianity</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Marriage was not merely social.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It was covenant.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">📖 Rooted in Genesis<br/>✝️ Reflected Christ and the Church<br/>🙏 Seen as sacred before God</p>
      <p className="mb-4">To forbid marriage was to interfere with something believers considered holy.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">And that is where Valentine enters the story.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">⛪ Who Was Valentine</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">The historical record is not perfectly clear.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">There were at least two early Christian martyrs named Valentine.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">One was a priest in Rome.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Another was a bishop in Terni.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Over time, their stories may have blended together.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">What is consistent is this:</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Valentine was a Christian leader.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">And he defied Roman authority.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">🤫 Secret Weddings</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">According to Christian tradition, Valentine continued performing marriages in secret.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">🏠 In private homes<br/>🕯️ In hidden gatherings<br/>✝️ In the name of Christ</p>
      <p className="mb-4">He knew the consequences.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Christian leaders had already been executed under Roman rule.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Persecution was not theoretical.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It was real.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Valentine chose obedience over safety.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">⛓️ Arrest and Execution</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Valentine was eventually discovered and arrested.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">He was brought before Roman authorities.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Ordered to renounce Christ.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Ordered to submit.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">He refused.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Tradition holds that he was beaten and later executed around 269 AD.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Some accounts say he was beheaded.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">He died not for romance.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Not for culture.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But for allegiance to Christ.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">💌 Where the Love Letter Story Comes From</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Later legends add another detail.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">While imprisoned, Valentine is said to have befriended the jailer’s daughter.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Some stories claim he prayed for her healing.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Before execution, he allegedly wrote her a note signed:</p>
      <p className="mb-4">“From your Valentine.”</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Historians cannot confirm this detail with certainty.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But the story endured.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">And over centuries, it shaped cultural memory.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">🗓️ From Martyrdom to Holiday</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Valentine’s feast day was established by the church on February 14.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Originally, it was a day to honor a martyr.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">🙏 Reflection<br/>⛪ Church remembrance<br/>✝️ Celebration of faithful obedience</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Centuries later, the date became associated with romantic love, partly influenced by medieval poetry and cultural traditions.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Over time:</p>
      <p className="mb-4">💌 Letters replaced liturgy<br/>🍫 Gifts replaced remembrance<br/>🎉 Culture overshadowed sacrifice</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The name remained.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The meaning shifted.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">📖 Love That Costs Something</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">At its core, the original story of Valentine is about covenant and courage.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">🤝 Defending Christian marriage<br/>🛡️ Protecting sacred vows<br/>✝️ Refusing to deny Christ</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Valentine’s obedience cost him his life.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">That is the foundation beneath the modern celebration.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">📌 Why This Still Matters</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Valentine’s Day did not begin as commercial romance.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It began with conviction.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">In a culture that valued power and military dominance, one bishop quietly honored covenant.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">In a system that demanded compromise, one Christian refused.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The holiday now celebrates love.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Its origin story celebrates faithfulness.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Celebrate love.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Just remember that the name attached to the day belonged to a man who chose Christ over comfort.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">And paid for it with his life.</p>
