        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 text-gray-800">
          <li>Not one of the 12 disciples</li>
          <li>A Gentile (non-Jew)</li>
          <li>A physician <span className="text-gray-500">(Colossians 4:14)</span></li>
          <li>Close companion of the apostle Paul</li>
          <li>Author of the Gospel of Luke</li>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Luke Was a Gentile — And That Changes Everything <span role="img" aria-label="Earth">🌍</span></h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Luke is widely believed to be the only Gentile author in the New Testament.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">That means he was not Jewish. He did not grow up under the Law of Moses. He did not inherit the covenant promises by birth. He was an outsider. And yet, he became one of Christianity’s most important voices.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">That perspective matters. Because much of the early Church was made up of Gentiles — people who did not grow up in Jewish tradition. Luke wrote so they could understand.</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 text-gray-800 mb-4">
          <li>Jewish customs</li>
          <li>Religious practices</li>
          <li>Cultural traditions</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">He made sure no one felt lost while reading about Jesus. Luke didn’t just tell the story. He translated it for the world.</p>
      </section>
      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Luke the Beloved Physician <span role="img" aria-label="Stethoscope">🩺</span></h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Paul refers to him as:</p>
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-indigo-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-700 mb-4">“Luke, the beloved physician.”<br /><span className="text-gray-500">Colossians 4:14</span></blockquote>
        <p className="mb-4">This small detail reveals something powerful. Luke was educated. He was trained. He was precise. You can see it in his writing:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 text-gray-800 mb-4">
          <li>Detailed medical descriptions</li>
          <li>Accurate geographical references</li>
          <li>Named political leaders</li>
          <li>Ordered chronology</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">Luke writes like a historian. Because he was one.</p>
      </section>
      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Luke Was a Firsthand Witness to the Early Church</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Luke may not have walked with Jesus in Galilee. But he walked with Paul across the Roman Empire.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">In the Book of Acts — which Luke also wrote — the narration shifts at one point from “they” to “we.”</p>
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-indigo-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-700 mb-4">Acts 16:10</blockquote>
        <p className="mb-4">That subtle shift tells us something huge. Luke joined the mission. He didn’t just record history. He lived it.</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 text-gray-800 mb-4">
          <li>Traveled on missionary journeys</li>
          <li>Endured persecution</li>
          <li>Survived a shipwreck <span className="text-gray-500">(Acts 27)</span></li>
          <li>Stayed with Paul during imprisonment</li>
          <li>Remained loyal until the end <span className="text-gray-500">(2 Timothy 4:11)</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">Luke wasn’t observing Christianity. He was part of its expansion.</p>
      </section>
      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Luke and Acts Were One Unified Project <span role="img" aria-label="Book">📖</span></h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Luke wrote two books:</p>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-1 text-gray-800 mb-4">
          <li>The Gospel of Luke</li>
          <li>The Book of Acts</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="mb-4">Both are addressed to someone named Theophilus.</p>
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-indigo-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-700 mb-2">Luke 1:3<br />Acts 1:1</blockquote>
        <p className="mb-4">The name “Theophilus” means “lover of God.” Some believe he was a Roman official. Others believe the name symbolizes any seeker of truth. Either way, Luke states his mission clearly:</p>
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-indigo-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-700 mb-4">“I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning and decided to write an orderly account… so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.”<br /><span className="text-gray-500">Luke 1:3–4</span></blockquote>
        <p className="mb-4">Luke wasn’t writing myth. He was documenting reality. He interviewed eyewitnesses. He verified details. He organized events. He created a two-volume historical account of:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 text-gray-800 mb-4">
          <li>The life of Jesus</li>
          <li>The birth of the Church</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">What Makes Luke’s Gospel Unique?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">There are four Gospels:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 text-gray-800 mb-4">
          <li>Matthew</li>
          <li>Mark</li>
          <li>Luke</li>
          <li>John</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">Each emphasizes something different. Luke highlights:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 text-gray-800 mb-4">
          <li>Jesus’ compassion</li>
          <li>The poor and marginalized</li>
          <li>Women in the Gospel story</li>
          <li>Outsiders being welcomed</li>
          <li>Long narrative parables</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">Only Luke records:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 text-gray-800 mb-4">
          <li>The Good Samaritan</li>
          <li>The Prodigal Son</li>
          <li>The Rich Man and Lazarus</li>
          <li>The detailed birth narrative</li>
          <li>Mary’s emotional reflection <span className="text-gray-500">(Luke 2:19)</span></li>
          <li>The road to Emmaus encounter</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">Luke shows a Savior who seeks the lost. Not just the religious. Not just the powerful. Everyone.</p>
      </section>
      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Was Luke Spirit-Inspired? <span role="img" aria-label="Fire">🔥</span></h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Yes. Luke did not personally follow Jesus during His ministry. But inspiration does not depend on proximity. Jesus promised:</p>
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-indigo-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-700 mb-4">“The Holy Spirit… will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.”<br /><span className="text-gray-500">John 14:26</span></blockquote>
        <p className="mb-4">The same Spirit that guided the apostles guided Luke. His Gospel and Acts are not simply well-researched history. They are Scripture. Authoritative. God-breathed. Trustworthy.</p>
      </section>
      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Why Luke Still Matters Today</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 text-gray-800 mb-4">
          <li>Christianity is historically grounded</li>
          <li>The Gospel is for outsiders</li>
          <li>Jesus cares about the overlooked</li>
          <li>Faith and intellect are not enemies</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">Luke was:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 text-gray-800 mb-4">
          <li>A Gentile</li>
          <li>A doctor</li>
          <li>A researcher</li>
          <li>A missionary companion</li>
          <li>A Spirit-inspired author</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">God used someone outside the original twelve to shape the Church forever.</p>
      </section>
      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Final Takeaway</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Luke did not walk with Jesus in Galilee. But he walked with the ones who did. He listened. He investigated. He documented. And because of that, we have the most detailed historical account of Jesus’ life and the expansion of the early Church.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">God used a doctor. God used an outsider. God used Luke.</p>
