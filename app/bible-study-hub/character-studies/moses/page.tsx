        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Moses enters Scripture in the middle of genocide.</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Pharaoh has issued a decree:</p>
        <p className="mb-4">📖 Exodus 1:22 — Every Hebrew baby boy must be thrown into the Nile.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Israel is multiplying.<br/>Egypt feels threatened.<br/>Fear turns into oppression.<br/>Oppression turns into slaughter.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Mothers are hiding their newborns.<br/>Fathers are praying for miracles.<br/>The cries of the Hebrew people rise to heaven.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">And in the middle of that darkness — one woman makes a desperate decision.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">She builds a basket.<br/>Coats it in pitch.<br/>Places her three-month-old son inside.<br/>Sets him among the reeds of the Nile.<br/>She lets him go.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">That baby is Moses.<br/>The child who should have died.<br/>The child God would use to confront empires.</p>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">👶 Moses — The Child Who Should Have Died</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">The Nile does not swallow him.<br/>Instead, Pharaoh’s daughter finds him.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">📖 Exodus 2:6 — “She saw that he was a fine child, and she had compassion on him.”</p>
        <p className="mb-4">The irony is breathtaking.<br/>The same river meant to kill Hebrew sons becomes the river that saves one.<br/>Pharaoh orders death.<br/>Pharaoh’s daughter delivers life.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Moses grows up in two worlds:</p>
        <p className="mb-4">🔥 Hebrew by blood<br/>🔥 Egyptian by upbringing<br/>🔥 Raised in royalty<br/>🔥 Trained in “all the wisdom of the Egyptians” (📖 Acts 7:22)</p>
        <p className="mb-4">He is groomed for leadership in the most powerful empire on earth.<br/>But he belongs to a people in chains.<br/>From the beginning, Moses lives between identities.<br/>Palace comfort.<br/>Slave ancestry.<br/>Privilege.<br/>Oppression.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">God is shaping a deliverer long before Moses knows he needs to be one.</p>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">⚔️ Moses the Impulsive Deliverer</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Around the age of forty, something inside Moses breaks.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">📖 Exodus 2:11–12</p>
        <p className="mb-4">He sees an Egyptian beating a Hebrew slave.<br/>He looks around.<br/>No one sees.<br/>He kills the Egyptian.<br/>He hides the body.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">This is not cowardice.<br/>It is misdirected zeal.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">📖 Acts 7:25 tells us Moses thought his people would understand that God was using him to rescue them.<br/>They didn’t.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Instead, the next day, when Moses tries to intervene in a Hebrew dispute, he hears:<br/>“Who made you ruler and judge over us?” (📖 Exodus 2:14)</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Rejection cuts deeper than Pharaoh’s anger.<br/>When Pharaoh learns what happened, Moses runs.<br/>The prince becomes a fugitive.</p>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">🏜️ Forty Years of Silence</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Moses disappears into Midian.<br/>Not for weeks.<br/>Not for months.<br/>Forty years.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">He who was raised in a palace now tends sheep in obscurity.<br/>Forty years of:</p>
        <p className="mb-4">🔥 Humility<br/>🔥 Silence<br/>🔥 Routine<br/>🔥 Obscurity</p>
        <p className="mb-4">The palace built his education.<br/>The wilderness built his character.<br/>Sometimes God removes you from influence before He entrusts you with impact.<br/>Midian was not punishment.<br/>It was preparation.</p>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">🔥 The God Who Burns but Does Not Consume</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Then one ordinary day becomes history.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">📖 Exodus 3</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Moses sees a bush on fire.<br/>But it is not burning up.<br/>Curiosity draws him closer.<br/>Then he hears his name.<br/>“Moses… Moses.”<br/>Remove your sandals.<br/>The ground is holy.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">God introduces Himself as:<br/>“I AM WHO I AM.” (📖 Exodus 3:14)<br/>Not a tribal god.<br/>Not a regional deity.<br/>The self-existent One.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">God tells Moses:<br/>“I have seen the misery of My people… I have heard them crying out… and I am concerned about their suffering.” (📖 Exodus 3:7)</p>
        <p className="mb-4">He then says something shocking:<br/>“I am sending you.”<br/>Moses resists.<br/>“I am not qualified.”<br/>“I am not eloquent.”<br/>“They won’t listen to me.”<br/>God answers with one promise:<br/>“I will be with you.”<br/>That is the difference between human ambition and divine calling.</p>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">🌊 Moses the Deliverer</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Moses returns to Egypt.<br/>Not as a prince.<br/>As a shepherd with a staff.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Ten plagues strike Egypt.<br/>Each one dismantles a false god.<br/>Each one exposes Pharaoh’s weakness.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Finally, the Passover comes.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">📖 Exodus 12</p>
        <p className="mb-4">The blood of a lamb marks the homes of Israel.<br/>Judgment passes over them.<br/>Deliverance begins.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Then the sea stands in the way.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">📖 Exodus 14</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Pharaoh’s army closes in.<br/>Israel panics.<br/>Moses stands firm.<br/>“Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the Lord will bring you today.” (📖 Exodus 14:13)<br/>He raises his staff.<br/>The sea parts.<br/>Walls of water rise.<br/>Israel walks through on dry ground.<br/>The slaves walk out free.<br/>The empire collapses behind them.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Moses becomes the visible representative of the invisible God.</p>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">⛰️ Sinai and the Covenant</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Deliverance is not the end.<br/>It is the beginning.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">At Mount Sinai, Moses ascends into thunder and cloud.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">📖 Exodus 19–20</p>
        <p className="mb-4">He receives the Law.<br/>The Ten Commandments.<br/>The covenant that will define Israel’s identity.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Moses becomes:</p>
        <p className="mb-4">🔥 Lawgiver<br/>🔥 Mediator<br/>🔥 Intercessor</p>
        <p className="mb-4">When Israel builds the golden calf (📖 Exodus 32), Moses pleads for them.<br/>“Forgive their sin… but if not, blot me out of the book you have written.”<br/>This is shepherd leadership.<br/>Standing between judgment and the people.</p>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">🏕️ The Wilderness Leader</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">For forty more years, Moses leads a stubborn nation.<br/>They complain.<br/>They rebel.<br/>They doubt.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">He strikes the rock in frustration (📖 Numbers 20:11).<br/>And because of that moment of disobedience, he is told he will not enter the Promised Land.<br/>Even leaders face consequences.<br/>Even the faithful are not flawless.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Yet Scripture says:</p>
        <p className="mb-4">📖 Numbers 12:3 — “Now Moses was very humble, more than any man on the face of the earth.”<br/>The former prince became the most humble man alive.<br/>That is transformation.</p>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">📜 Moses the Writer</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Moses authors:</p>
        <p className="mb-4">🔥 Genesis<br/>🔥 Exodus<br/>🔥 Leviticus<br/>🔥 Numbers<br/>🔥 Deuteronomy<br/>🔥 Psalm 90</p>
        <p className="mb-4">He records creation.<br/>The fall.<br/>The flood.<br/>The patriarchs.<br/>The exodus.<br/>The Law.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">For fifteen hundred years, Israel stands on what Moses wrote.<br/>He becomes the foundational historian and theologian of God’s people.</p>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">⛰️ His Final Climb</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">After forty years of leading Israel, Moses climbs Mount Nebo.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">📖 Deuteronomy 34</p>
        <p className="mb-4">God shows him the Promised Land.<br/>He sees it.<br/>But he does not enter it.<br/>He dies there.<br/>And Scripture says:<br/>“The Lord buried him.” (📖 Deuteronomy 34:6)<br/>No shrine.<br/>No monument.<br/>No grave to worship.<br/>Just obedience.</p>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">✨ Final Reflection</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Moses was not perfect.<br/>He was impulsive.<br/>He doubted.<br/>He failed.<br/>But he was faithful.<br/>The child drawn out of the water.<br/>The shepherd drawn out of obscurity.<br/>The leader who drew a nation out of slavery.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Moses’ life proves something powerful:</p>
        <p className="mb-4">God prepares in hidden places.<br/>God calls the reluctant.<br/>God uses the imperfect.<br/>And sometimes, the man who never enters the Promise is still the man who leads everyone else to it.</p>
