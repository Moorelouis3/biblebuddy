        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Paul the Persecutor</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Before becoming an apostle, Paul actively hunted Christians.</p>
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-indigo-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-700 mb-4">Acts 8:3 — “Saul began to destroy the church.”</blockquote>
        <p className="mb-4">He approved of Stephen’s execution <span className="text-gray-500">(Acts 7:58)</span>.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">He believed he was defending God. He was zealous. Educated. Religious. And completely wrong.</p>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">The Damascus Road Encounter <span role="img" aria-label="Lightning">⚡</span></h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Everything changed in Acts 9.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">On his way to arrest more believers, a light from heaven stopped him.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Jesus spoke directly to him:</p>
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-indigo-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-700 mb-4">“Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?”<br /><span className="text-gray-500">Acts 9:4</span></blockquote>
        <p className="mb-4">Paul was blinded. Humbled. Confronted. In that moment, the persecutor met the risen Christ. And everything changed.</p>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Called to the Gentiles <span role="img" aria-label="Earth">🌍</span></h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Paul was uniquely positioned:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 text-gray-800 mb-4">
          <li>Jewish by heritage</li>
          <li>Roman by citizenship</li>
          <li>Fluent in Greek culture</li>
          <li>Deeply trained in Scripture</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">God used his background to reach the non-Jewish world. Paul became the primary missionary to the Gentiles. He traveled thousands of miles spreading the Gospel across the Roman Empire.</p>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Was Paul Spirit-Inspired? <span role="img" aria-label="Fire">🔥</span></h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Absolutely. Though not one of the original twelve, Paul was personally commissioned by Christ.</p>
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-indigo-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-700 mb-4">Galatians 1:11–12 — Paul states his Gospel came through revelation of Jesus Christ.</blockquote>
        <p className="mb-4">The early Church recognized his authority. His letters are Scripture. God-breathed. Authoritative.</p>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Paul’s Weakness and Humility</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Paul openly admitted his weaknesses.</p>
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-indigo-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-700 mb-4">2 Corinthians 12:9 — “My grace is sufficient for you…”</blockquote>
        <p className="mb-4">He referred to himself as:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 text-gray-800 mb-4">
          <li>The least of the apostles <span className="text-gray-500">(1 Corinthians 15:9)</span></li>
          <li>Chief of sinners <span className="text-gray-500">(1 Timothy 1:15)</span></li>
        </ul>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Final Takeaway</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Paul’s life proves something powerful:</p>
        <p className="mb-4">No one is too far gone.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">The man who persecuted Christians became the man who wrote most of the New Testament letters.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">God transformed him. Used him. Empowered him.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Paul’s story is not about human strength. It is about radical grace.</p>
