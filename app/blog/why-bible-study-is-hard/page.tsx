        <section className="mb-8">
          <p className="mb-4">If reading the Bible has ever felt frustrating, confusing, or inconsistent, you are not alone.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Many people want to study Scripture.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">They start with good intentions.<br/>They feel motivated.<br/>They commit to doing better.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">And then somewhere along the way, it fades.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Not because they stopped caring.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">But because something underneath the surface was never addressed.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Bible study feels hard for real reasons.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">And unless those reasons are named clearly, shame quietly fills the gap.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">This article is not about guilt.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">It is about clarity.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Let’s talk honestly about why studying the Bible feels difficult for so many people.</p>
        </section>
        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">📖 Reason 1: The Motivation Is Misplaced</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">When something feels like pressure, resistance grows.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">You sit down to read and suddenly:</p>
          <p className="mb-4">🧠 The mind wanders<br/>⏰ Everything else feels urgent<br/>📖 The Bible feels heavy</p>
          <p className="mb-4">That is not a lack of love for God.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">It is motivation built on guilt.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">And guilt never sustains consistency.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">When Scripture becomes about checking a box, it loses its warmth.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">But when it becomes about knowing the One who speaks through it, something shifts.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Not instantly.<br/>Not dramatically.<br/>But steadily.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Just like building strength.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">🏋️ At first it feels unfamiliar<br/>✨ Then understanding begins to click<br/>📖 A verse lands deeper<br/>🧩 A connection forms</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Consistency follows clarity, not pressure.</p>
        </section>
        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">🔐 Reason 2: Scripture Feels Locked</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">“Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.”<br/>Luke 24:45</p>
          <p className="mb-4">The Bible does not read like a modern novel.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">And most people are never told that.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">It was written in ancient languages.<br/>Within unfamiliar cultures.<br/>Across thousands of years.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">When Scripture is opened without context, confusion builds quickly.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">It feels frustrating because:</p>
          <p className="mb-4">📝 Translations vary in wording<br/>📜 Stories reference events not yet understood<br/>👤 Names appear without explanation<br/>📚 Writing styles shift without warning</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Confusion does not mean lack of intelligence.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">It often means lack of tools.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Even the disciples needed their understanding opened.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Confusion is not failure.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">It is a signal that guidance is needed.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Understanding Scripture requires context.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Without context, even faithful readers feel lost.</p>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">⏳ Reason 3: Too Much, Too Fast</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">“Whoever gathers little by little will increase it.”<br/>Proverbs 13:11</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Many people move from reading nothing to attempting large portions every day.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Three chapters.<br/>Four chapters.<br/>Entire reading plans.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">It sounds spiritual.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">But it is rarely sustainable.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Growth that lasts is built slowly.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">When pace outruns comprehension, discouragement follows.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">What usually happens:</p>
          <p className="mb-4">🏃 Reading becomes rushed<br/>❓ Understanding becomes shallow<br/>➡️ Pages turn but meaning does not stick<br/>🫥 Progress feels invisible</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Eventually the question arises: what is the point?</p>
          <p className="mb-4">More chapters does not equal deeper growth.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Slower reading builds stronger roots.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">This is not a race.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">God is not measuring speed.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">He is cultivating depth.</p>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">🗓️ Reason 4: There Is No Plan</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">“Good planning and hard work lead to prosperity.”<br/>Proverbs 21:5</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Bible study is not random.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">It is a habit.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">And habits require structure.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Most people intend to read Scripture.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">They simply never decide when.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">So reading gets pushed to later.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">And later rarely arrives.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Without a plan, decision fatigue takes over.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">🕰️ When should reading happen<br/>⏱️ How long should it last<br/>📖 What section should be opened</p>
          <p className="mb-4">A plan answers those questions before the day begins.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">A plan removes excuses.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">A plan protects time.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Even ten focused minutes matter when they are intentional.</p>
        </section>
        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">🧩 Reason 5: There Is No System</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">“Hold on to the pattern of sound teaching.”<br/>2 Timothy 1:13</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Many people read the Bible.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">But they do not engage it.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">They do not:</p>
          <p className="mb-4">❓ Ask questions<br/>📝 Write observations<br/>🤔 Wrestle with meaning<br/>🧠 Apply truth personally</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Reading without engagement feels distant.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">A system turns passive reading into active discovery.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">A system gives structure to curiosity.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">It gives the mind direction.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">It reduces overwhelm.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">It makes growth measurable.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">And once structure exists, consistency becomes possible.</p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">🔥 The Truth About the Struggle</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">Struggling with Bible study does not mean laziness.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">It does not mean spiritual weakness.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">It often means no one ever explained how to build a sustainable rhythm.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Clarity replaces shame.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Structure replaces confusion.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Small intentional steps replace burnout.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Bible study is not about perfection.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">It is about building something that lasts.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">And once the foundation is right, everything changes.</p>
