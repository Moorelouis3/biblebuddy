## New blog post touches contested doctrine: eternal security
The blog writer agent just published "Can You Lose Your Salvation? What
the Bible Says" (/blog/can-you-lose-your-salvation). This covers eternal
security / "once saved always saved" vs. conditional security, a topic
sincere Christians genuinely disagree on. The post presents both views
honestly (John 10:28-29, Romans 8:38-39, Philippians 1:6 for eternal
security; Hebrews 6:4-6, Hebrews 10:26-27, 2 Peter 2:20-21 for
conditional security) without preaching one as settled fact, per the
format spec's doctrinal-sensitivity rule. Louis should read it himself
since this ships unreviewed.

## Level 2 upgrade agent can't reach Life Buddy's API
The scheduled Level 2 upgrade run at 2026-08-15 12:26 UTC couldn't pull the
queue at all — the container's network egress proxy blocks
life-buddy-production.up.railway.app with a 403 (confirmed via both curl and
WebFetch, so it's a policy denial, not a flaky connection). This means the
Level 2 pipeline is fully stuck: no chapter can be pulled, converted, or
reported complete until this environment's egress allowlist includes that
Railway domain. Needs an admin to add it to the session/environment's egress
policy.
